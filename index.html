  <p>Hello.</p>
  <p>My name is <strong>Matt Borja</strong> and this is now my website: the embodiment of <em>simple elegance</em> (which I'll go into more detail later).</p>
  <p>I've explored a lot, I've done a lot, and then I've been through a lot. But to go into any of it now would needlessly throw me back into the exhausting endeavor of trying to prove to you something I've already proven to myself: that either I can do, or that I am; and that's simply not my main focus right now.</p>
  <p>All I can say is that there definitely will be meaningful and impactful (industry) content coming in the following weeks and months, time permitting.</p>
  <p>And so, with that, I'd like to thank you for stopping by and wish you the best rest of your day.</p>
  <p>&mdash; MB</p>
