            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Matt Borja</strong> and this is now my website: the embodiment of <em>simple elegance</em> (which I'll go into more detail later).</p>
            <p>I've explored a lot, I've done a lot, and then I've been through a lot. But to go into any of it now would needlessly throw me back into the exhausting endeavor of trying to prove to you something I've already proven to myself: that either I can do, or that I am; and that's simply not my main focus right now.</p>
            <p>All I can say is that there definitely will be meaningful and impactful (industry) content coming in the following weeks and months, time permitting.</p>
            <p>And so, with that, I'd like to thank you for stopping by and wish you the best rest of your day.</p>

            <h1>The What and Why</h1>
            <p>For starters, this website was created on <em>Friday, June 3, 2022</em> and built in <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The platform doubles as a form of "simultaenous cross-training" in minimally keeping me immersed in the various aspects of the software development life cycle and release management processes, even when all I'm doing is rambling on in a blog post about things no one else probably cares about.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first thing I did when deciding what initial page to drop as my home page, I knew I wanted to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> as a frontend framework for styling and handling *responsive design*, but also decided to use pair it with some starter HTML markup from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> instead. However, upon further inspection of the underlying source code, I quickly found additional adjustments I wanted to make to the markup: including, but not limited to, *self-closing* META tags. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to distance myself from the rather irritating and prolific "cookie-cut" experience that copy-and-paste produces.</li>
                <li>HTML5 is a standard that didn't originate with Bootstrap. I am more interested in things being done properly, consistently, and to the greatest degree of quality and semantic correctness possible (it's somewhat of an obsesssion of mine, you could say). To the extent that Bootstrap, jQuery, and the endless list of other opinionated frameworks help me to achieve my personal goals, I'll use them on an as-needed basis. But at the point where they begin to obstruct me from reaching those goals, then may be the time to reconsider other options. As we say in software engineering, "...tools for the job."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm not writing very detailed commit messages at this time. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are times when I've almost written an entire press release for a single, admittedly large commit, as a personal accountability measure. However, going back to the introduction of this website; while I would love to impress you with an endless stream of well-written commit messages every time I change a line on this website, right now that's simply not my main focus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this time, I am only editing this website via GitHub's web interface. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Besides the convenience of a portable IDE (device-agnostic, OS-agnostic, network-agnostic, etc.), I'm asserting authenticity of every change to this website via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vigilant Mode</a> whereby you can go back into <a href="https://github.com/mattborja/mattborja.github.io/commits/master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the change history of this repository</a> and see that every commit is signed by me.</li>
                <li>I have also added my other current PGP key to my account for future use, with the following fingerprint: <a href="https://keybase.io/mattborja" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><code>F30FF4FC936584574EE3251833688C2EDC08CD38</code></a> (more on this later).</li>
            </ul>
