            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Matt Borja</strong> and this is now my website: the embodiment of <em>simple elegance</em> (which I'll go into more detail later).</p>
            <p>I've explored a lot, I've done a lot, and then I've been through a lot. But to go into any of it now would needlessly throw me back into the exhausting endeavor of trying to prove to you something I've already proven to myself: that either I can do, or that I am; and that's simply not my main focus right now.</p>
            <p>All I can say is that there definitely will be meaningful and impactful (industry) content coming in the following weeks and months, time permitting.</p>
            <p>And so, with that, I'd like to thank you for stopping by and wish you the best rest of your day.</p>
            <p>&mdash; MB</p>

            <h1>The What and Why</h1>
            <p>For starters, this website was created on <em>Friday, June 3, 2022</em> and built in <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The platform doubles as a form of "simultaenous cross-training" in minimally keeping me immersed in the various aspects of the software development life cycle and release management processes, even when all I'm doing is rambling on in a blog post about things no one else probably cares about.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first thing I did when deciding what initial page to drop as my home page, I knew I wanted to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> as a frontend framework for styling and handling <em>responsive design</em>, but opted to pair it with some starter HTML markup from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> instead. And after making <a href="https://www.w3.org/2010/04/xhtml10-strict.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a few preferred adjustments to the markup</a>, I had something I was satisfied with (both inside and out). Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to distance myself from the rather irritating and prolific "cookie-cut" experience that copy-and-paste produces.</li>
                <li>HTML5 is a standard that didn't originate with Bootstrap. I am more interested in things being done properly, consistently, and to the greatest degree of quality and semantic correctness possible (it's somewhat of an obsesssion of mine, you could say). To the extent that Bootstrap, jQuery, and the endless list of other opinionated frameworks help me to achieve my personal goals, I'll use them on an as-needed basis. But at the point where they begin to obstruct me from reaching those goals, then may be the time to reconsider other options. As we say in software engineering, "...tools for the job."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm not writing very detailed commit messages at this time. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are times when I've almost written an entire press release for a single, admittedly large commit, as a personal accountability measure. However, going back to the introduction of this website; while I would love to impress you with an endless stream of well-written commit messages every time I change a line on this website, right now that's simply not my main focus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At this time, I am only editing this website via GitHub's web interface. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Besides the convenience of a portable IDE (device-agnostic, OS-agnostic, network-agnostic, etc.), I'm asserting authenticity of every change to this website via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vigilant Mode</a> whereby you can go back into <a href="https://github.com/mattborja/mattborja.github.io/commits/master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the change history of this repository</a> and see that every commit is signed by me.</li>
                <li>I have also added my other current PGP key to my account for future use, with the following fingerprint: <a href="https://keybase.io/mattborja" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><code>F30FF4FC936584574EE3251833688C2EDC08CD38</code></a> (more on this later).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm in the process of planning and writing a reference (or book of sorts) documenting every PGP key I've independently verified. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because high risk environments are within only a few clicks of highly skilled attackers; and can only be defended by high quality professionals who understand the <strong>non-negotiable duty of due diligence</strong>.</li>
                <li>To streamline ID verification for those who trust me (see also <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Building your web of trust</em></a> in Chapter 4 of The GNU Privacy Handbook).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I crack the best jokes known to mankind in public forum, as often as the opportunity allows (which is not many). Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because I often find them very relevant, clever, and funny; even when no one else does. I'm like the mischievous kid who knows how to make the teacher laugh at something they probably shouldn't be laughing at. It is always a race to see who can come up with the last pun.</li>
                <li>Also, because my kids ask for them. And when your kids ask you for a dad joke, you know you got something going for you in life (even if all that is is dad jokes). You could say, it's what separates the dads from the men.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I sometimes start my day at 2:30 AM, even when work doesn't start until 7 AM. Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because it is biologically impossible for engineers to get a good night's rest when the unicorn still hasn't revealed itself after the 4 hours spent looking at the same 5 lines of code (and when you try to help the situation, it only results in more things breaking). It's like a rain dance or ritual gone horribly wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am the proud owner of a GTRACING Racing gaming chair (the one with the footrest). Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Besides enraging my middle with jealousy (what? he's got the rocker with bluetooth speakers so I don't see what the issue is...), the hard dining room chairs were killing my back after 2 hours of work.</li>
                <li>Also, it's a convertible bed comfortable enough to sleep in (see 2:30 AM reference).</li>
            </ul>
